<h1>Eli Jordan: Lorenz Attractor</h1>
<p>I compiled on MacOS with #ifdef for imports so it should work for Linux as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate into the directory</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> this should make an executable called lorenz</li>
<li>Run <code>./lorenz</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arrows to change view angle</li>
<li>q/e to increase/decrease <code>s</code> variable</li>
<li>-/+ to increase/decrease <code>r</code></li>
<li>z/c to increase/decrease <code>w</code> size variable</li>
<li>ESC to exit</li>
<li>0 to reset view angle</li>
</ul>

<p>While I didn't get much into how the Lorenz attractor itself worked, this was an interesting exercise into how the graphics and color can be manipulated with user input. I probably spent about 3 hours total on this assignment. The first hour or so was trying to get the program to compile before I copied all of ex6. After that I was just messing around with the variables and user input.</p>
