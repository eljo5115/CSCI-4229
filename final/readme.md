<p>I struggled to find BMP textures and I was fairly intent on making them myself with Photoshop. Photoshop doesn't like making bitmap images with color so I ended up just making PNGs with Illustrator and uploading them to an online converter to get 24 bit BMPs. This ended up working quite well and they were able to be imported into the scene pretty easily.</p>
