<h1>Eli Jordan: Procedural Golf Course</h1>
<p>This is a project to explore the methodology behind creating a golf course procedurally. The main idea was to have a contiguous surface from the tee box to the green (fairway) with some obstacles lining the path. Unfortunately I ran out of time to implement any sort of water hazards. The light position is meant to simulate different times of day (morning, noon, afternoon, sunset). The different camera modes are to show the various angles of the course as you play the hole. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Run <code>make</code> this should make an executable called main</li>
    <li>Run <code>./main</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<ul>
    <li>m to change camera modes</li>
    <li>f to change light position</li>
    <li>n to generate new hole</li>
    <li>w/s to zoom in/out in green view mode</li>
</ul>
