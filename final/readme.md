<h1>Eli Jordan: Procedural Golf Course</h1>
<p>What is currently lacking is the final camera mode (flyover) and adding some various trees. I need to add some variation to the fairway shape but my initial implementation did not work very well. I'm also planning on making the fairway much wider so that I can draw trees and add some completeness to the scene. If that gets done before too long, I'll start trying to add some random water or sand.</p>
<p>Ambient light is cranked at the moment for easy viewing of the entire terrain.</p>
